# README

Howdy, my name is David Husa and this is my takehome evaluation for Placements.io.

I elected to create my own application from scratch as the example boilerplate application was out of date, so this uses the currently most up-to-date Ruby on Rails version of 7.1.1 with Ruby 3.2.2. Also it's been a few years since I worked in React so I elected to use the Stimulus/Hotwire front-end paradigm.

Run the following commands to install and run the application:
1) Ensure you're using Ruby 3.2.2 in the project folder.

2) Install the gems
* bundle install

3) Set up the database and seed with data
* rails db:migrate
* rails db:seed
